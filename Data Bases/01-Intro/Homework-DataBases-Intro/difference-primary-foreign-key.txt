	Te primary key is database table column data which holds unique value (numeric, string), used 
to select the data saved in the coresponding row.
	The foreign key is database table column data which holds unique value (numeric, string),
used to conect data arguments in separate tables.

coresponding to it`s own data table in contrast foreign key coresponds to data in a different 
, outer data table.
