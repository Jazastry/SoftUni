	A table in DataBase terms corresponds to a predicate variable. The contents of a table to a 
relation, key constraints, other constraints, and SQL queries correspond to predicates.
	The information is tables is stored in a way to corespond and answer to all constrains asked by
the column and table predicates, no data is stored if all constrains are not satisfied.
	The difference between tables and relations is that in the tables are stored information 
and predicates related to data storing, in contrast in relations are stored the relations 
between dta tables.
