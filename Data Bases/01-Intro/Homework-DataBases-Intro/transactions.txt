Transactions

		A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. Transactions are units or sequences 
	of work	accomplished in a logical order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or automatically by 
	some sort of a database program.
		A transaction is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. For example, if you are
	creating a record or updating a record or deleting a record from the table, then you are performing transaction
	on the table. It is important to control transactions to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors.
	Practically, you will club many SQL queries into a group and you will execute all of them together as a part 
	of a transaction.
