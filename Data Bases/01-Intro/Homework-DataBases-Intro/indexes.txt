Datbase Indexing

	A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations 
	on a database table.

	Indexing Methods

		- non-clustered
			The data is present in arbitrary order, but the logical ordering is specified by 
			the index. The data rows may be spread throughout the table regardless of the 
			value of the indexed column or expression. The non-clustered index tree contains 
			the index keys in sorted order, with the leaf level of the index containing the 
			pointer to the record.
		- clustered
			Clustering alters the data block into a certain distinct order to match the index, 
			resulting in the row data being stored in order. Therefore, only one clustered 
			index can be created on a given database table. Clustered indices can greatly 
			increase overall speed of retrieval, but usually only where the data is accessed 
			sequentially in the same or reverse order of the clustered index, or when a range 
			of items is selected.

	Indexing speeds up retrieving table information by indrexed columns much faster, but 
	dealing (deleting, updating) indexed columns is slower, because of need to be changed 
	also index information.
